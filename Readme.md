## Agile Manifesto

```
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

```

The things on the right matter, but the things on the left are more important.

##Tools

These tools all solve problems:

| Problem  | Solution  |  Comment  | 
|:-:|---|---|---|---|
| Forecasting  | Estimates  |  TODO  | 
| Scheduling  | Sprint Planning  |  TODO  | 
| Visibility  | Kanban Board  |  TODO  | 
| Feedback  | Retrospective  |  TODO  | 
| Specifications  | Stories  |  TODO  | 
| Agility  | Standups  |  TODO  | 
| Changing Specs  | Sprints  |  TODO  |

## Abnormal Termination

Abnormal termination is essentially blowing up the sprint and starting a new sprint instead. 

# Roles

## Scrum::product backlog

The product backlog is another artifact of Scrum. This is the complete list of the functionality that remains to be added to the product. The product owner prioritizes the backlog so the team always works on the most valuable features first.

## Scrum::sprint backlog

The sprint backlog is the list of tasks the team needs to perform in order to deliver the functionality it committed to deliver during the sprint.

## Scrum::Product Owner

The Product Owner (PO) is the member of the team responsible for defining Stories and prioritizing the Team Backlog so as to streamline the execution of program priorities.

## Scrum::Scrumaster

A scrum master is the facilitator for a product development team that uses scrum, a rugby analogy for a development methodology that allows a team to self-organize and make changes quickly. The scrum master manages the process for how information is exchanged.

A good ScrumMaster shelters the team from outside distractions, allowing team members to focus maniacally during the sprint on the goal they have selected.

While the ScrumMaster focuses on helping the team be the best that it can be, the product owner works to direct the team to the right goal. The product owner does this by creating a compelling vision of the product, and then conveying that vision to the team through the product backlog.

The third and final role in Scrum project management is the Scrum team itself. Although individuals may join the team with various job titles, in Scrum, those titles are insignificant. Scrum methodology states that each person contributes in whatever way they can to complete the work of each sprint.

## Scrum::retrospective

No matter how good a Scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve. Although a good Scrum team will be constantly looking for improvement opportunities, the team should set aside a brief, dedicated period at the end of each sprint to deliberately reflect on how they are doing and to find ways to improve. This occurs during the sprint retrospective.

The sprint retrospective is usually the last thing done in a sprint. Many teams will do it immediately after the sprint review. The entire team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate. You can schedule a scrum retrospective for up to an hour, which is usually quite sufficient. However, occasionally a hot topic will arise or a team conflict will escalate and the retrospective could take significantly longer.

Although there are many ways to conduct an agile sprint retrospective, our recommendation is to conduct it as a start-stop-continue meeting. This is perhaps the simplest, but often the most effective way to conduct a retrospective. Using this approach each team member is asked to identify specific things that the team should:

Start doing
Stop doing
Continue doing

## Scrum::Scrum team

Within the Scrum Framework all work delivered to the customer is done by dedicated Scrum Teams. A Scrum Team is a collection of individuals working together to deliver the requested and committed product increments.

To work effectively it is important for a Scrum Team that everyone within the team
follows a common goal
adheres the same norms and rules
shows respect to each other

# FAQ

### Kanban: Physical or virtual

Some teams prefer physical Kanban boards over virtual ones. A physical board uses sticky notes or index cards for the Kanban cards, and the board is drawn on a whiteboard or wall.  TODO: flesh this out.
